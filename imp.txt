If a branch is deleted and leaves some commits unreachable from existing branches, those commits will continue to be accessible by commit id, until Gitâ€™s garbage collection runs. This will happen automatically from time to time, unless you actively turn it off. You can also run this process manually with git gc


To merge two branches

git merge branch1 branch2


to delet a branch

git branch -d branch_name
